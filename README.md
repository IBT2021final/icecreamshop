# Ice Cream Shop
This is the final group project of Internet Business Technologies (OPIM 668) developed by Group 2, hosted by https://pages.github.com/.
View live in https://ibt2021final.github.io/icecreamshop.

## Website content
Due to the pandemic, many businesses had to choose between transitioning to online orders or closing their doors to customers.
This is a website to order and pay for ice cream to ensure that people will be able to order ice cream in a covid-safe way (for both customers and employees).

## Usage
Use the form to enter your preferences for an ice cream. Once yout submit the form, the webpage will do an AJAX pull from a back-end database which contains the price for each selection. Based on the selections, the webpage will calculate and display the total amount due.
