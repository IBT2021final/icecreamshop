# Ice Cream Shop
This is the final group project of Internet Business Technologies (OPIM 668) developed by Group 2, hosted by https://pages.github.com/.
View live in https://ibt2021final.github.io/icecreamshop.

## Website content
Due to the pandemic, many businesses had to choose between transitioning to online orders or closing their doors to customers.
This is a website to order and pay for ice cream to ensure that people will be able to order ice cream in a covid-safe way (for both customers and employees).

## Usage
Use the form to enter your preferences for an ice cream. Once you submit the form, the webpage will use client-side javascript to do an AJAX pull from a back-end database. We created a back-end database that contains the price for each selection. The AJAX pulls it from the hosted page (like any other API) and not from the internal directories.  Based on your selections, the webpage will calculate and display the total amount due.
